## My Python projects assigned to me by The Tech Academy
In this Python repository, I made multiple projects including: a Phonebook and a Check Files GUI.

In the [Phonebook project](https://github.com/CarterT101/Python_Projects/tree/main/Python%20Practice/Phone%20Book/project_phonebook), I created a basic phonebook that has a database connected to it in which you can input your name, phone number, and email address to be stored and can be retrieved for use later.

For the [File Transfer project](https://github.com/CarterT101/Python_Projects/tree/main/File%20transfer%20assignment), you can transfer files based on time modified in the last 24 hours and the file extension type ".txt."
